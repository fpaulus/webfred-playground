# About

I’m an experienced [consultant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederikpaulus/) with broad knowledge of banking and financial markets. Throughout my career, I've worked both as an advisor and in line roles, in Singapore, London and Belgium. I've worked on assignments such as framework definitions and system implementations in risk and finance, in an international context. My line experience is focused on operational risk and capital management for global investment banks. Through these roles I’ve gained experience in managing international teams, including offshore, defining strategies and operating models and all stages of a system implementation lifecycle.

I’m also a research analyst in economic policy for [REFSA](https://refsa.org), focusing on Malaysia and the South-East Asian region. I’m mainly interested in the interplay between the financial sector and the real economy in an international context, the transmission mechanisms of fiscal and monetary policy and the role of the government in fostering a well-functioning market with fair and just outcomes.

Further afield, I’m fascinated by the rise of digital technology and its economic, social and political ramifications. I write an occasional [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/fpaulus) centred on these topics, with a particular focus on privacy and technology regulation–[subscribe here](https://buttondown.email/fpaulus).

I also run, take photographs and [express](https://mastodon.social/@fpaulus) [opinions](https://bsky.app/profile/fpaulus.bsky.social), sometimes.
